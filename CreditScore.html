                <p>A lot of people ask me, how can they improve their credit score. Some think there’s an easy fix or
                    credit kit. BUT truthfully, it’s all about managing your money.
                    Earlier this week I posted about building your savings and creating a spending plan these are two
                    important ingredients to a good score.</p><br>

                <p>If you build your savings you rely less on credit. Did you know one part of your credit score is
                    based on the amount of credit you are using.
                    The magic number is about 30%. Which means if you have a credit limit on a credit or store card of
                    $1,000 you should have no more than $300 charged to it and it should be paid off every billing
                    cycle.</p><br>

                <p>Paying your bills on time or early makes up about 35% of your credit score. One of the things the
                    lender wants to know is will you pay them on time.</p><br>

                <h3>The other factors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How long you’ve had credit accounts (15%)</li>
                    <li>Any recent credit inquires (10%)</li>
                    <li>Do you have a mix of credit types – car loans, mortgage and or credit cards (10%)</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p>Rod Griffin, Experian’s director of public education said on Nerd Wallet, </p>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/30-percent-credit-utilization-ratio-rule/">
                    “The 30% level is <u>not</u> a target, but rather is a <b>maximum limit</b>. <i>Exceeding</i> that level will have <em>significantly</em> negative
                    impact on credit scores”
                </blockquote>

                <p>Do yourself a favor, save your credit for major life events, like buying a house or car.
                    When you decide to buy ANYTHING using a loan and yes ANYTIME you are not paying cash and using a
                    credit card or getting financed you're using borrowed money, i.e. a loan. Think of it as a business
                    decision, look at the full cost.</p><br>

                <p>Item Cost + Interest+ Any fees +Amount of time to pay it off = Full cost</p><br>

                <p>Be Your own stimulus package.</p><br>

                <p>Control your money, control your life</p><br>
